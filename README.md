## How It Works

### Master Point ‚Äî The main module of the system that manages the ProTimer network.

1. **Power On and Connect:**

    - Turn on the Master Point; it will create a Wi-Fi network (the name is listed on the device).
    - Connect to this network using your smartphone, tablet, or laptop.

2. **Access the Control Interface:**

    - Use the interface to configure modes, control the timer, and export data.

3. **Connecting to the Router:**

    - During the first setup, the device will ask for your home Wi-Fi network name and password. This is required for automatic data export to the cloud.
    - Once configured, the device will automatically connect to the specified router every time it is powered on and upload your data to the ProTimer.club cloud.
    - This means that after your training session, you just need to turn on the device for a few seconds ‚Äî it will connect to Wi-Fi and export all your results automatically. Simple and convenient!
